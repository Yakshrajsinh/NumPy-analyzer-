# NumPy Array Analyzer

This project is an interactive Python-based NumPy utility that allows users to create, manipulate, analyze, search, slice, filter, combine, split, and perform mathematical/statistical operations on 1D, 2D, and 3D NumPy arrays through a command-line interface.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Array Creation
- Create **1D, 2D, and 3D arrays** using user input.
- Displays original array after creation.

### ✔ Mathematical Operations
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
(Applied between two user-defined arrays)

### ✔ Statistical Operations
- Sum
- Mean
- Median
- Standard Deviation
- Variance

### ✔ Search / Sort / Filter
- Search a value (shows index positions)
- Sort array based on dimensions
- Filter using conditions (> , < , ==)

### ✔ Indexing & Slicing
- Index using tuples e.g., `1,2`
- Slice using `start:end` format for n-dimensional arrays

### ✔ Combine / Split Arrays
- Concatenate using axis
- Split into parts or custom indices
